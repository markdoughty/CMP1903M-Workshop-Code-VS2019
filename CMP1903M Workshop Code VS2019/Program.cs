            //
            //Read each line of the input.
            //Determine whether it is a 'acc' or 'jmp' command for each line
            //Determine the value on each line
            //Find the value of 'acc' at the end
            //HINT: We can read each line as an array (or List) of strings; check [0] for 'a' or 'j', then check [4] and [5] for the values
            //OR: we could split each string at the space into an operation string and a value string
            //Can we read line by line instead of storing in a collection?


            //Week 4
            //Task 1: Add constructors to the Person() class
            //Task 2: create a 'screenName' field within Person
            //Task 3: Create a 'collection' of Person, iterate (i.e. loop) through the collection outputting data for each Person
